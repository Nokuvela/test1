Source Code Management Life Cycle for Collaborative Software Development
Source code management (SCM) is crucial for managing changes to software projects and facilitating collaboration among team members. The SCM life cycle consists of several stages, each playing a vital role in the development process.

1. Planning Stage
During the planning stage, the team defines project goals, identifies requirements, and plans the development process. This involves creating project timelines, allocating resources, and defining milestones. Example: Creating a project roadmap and setting up a project management tool like Jira.

2. Development Stage
In the development stage, developers write code, implement features, and make changes to the project. This stage involves collaboration among team members to build and enhance the software product. Example: Writing code for a new feature and using version control systems like Git for code collaboration.

3. Testing Stage
The testing stage involves testing the software to identify bugs, errors, and usability issues. This stage ensures the quality and reliability of the software product before deployment. Example: Performing unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests using testing frameworks like JUnit or Selenium.

4. Deployment Stage
During the deployment stage, the software is deployed to production or staging environments for end-users to access. Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the deployment process, ensuring smooth and reliable releases. Example: Deploying code changes to a production server using CI/CD tools like Jenkins or Travis CI.

5. Maintenance Stage
The maintenance stage involves ongoing support and maintenance of the software product. This includes addressing bug fixes, implementing updates, and providing technical support to end-users. Example: Monitoring application performance, responding to user feedback, and releasing patches or updates as needed.
